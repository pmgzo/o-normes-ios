# O-Normes IOS

This project is one of the applications that has been developed for our EIP project called O-Normes.

For this project we have iterated continously with real clients. Take you time to read the code.

This was my first IOS app, the app is not perfect and may contain bugs...

If think it is anyway a good idea to share this project in the case you want to improve it or use it for what it is meant to be.

Good luck, feel free to open a pull request to improve it or to ask question maybe ?

Sincerely,

PM
